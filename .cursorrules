# Historic Reenactors Project Rules

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14+ App Router with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS only (no inline styles unless required for accessibility)
- React Server Components by default, Client Components only when necessary

## Code Standards

### Accessibility
- All components must be accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Every page must have:
  - Title/description metadata
  - H1 with proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
  - At least one CTA for conversion pages
- Images must include alt text; decorative images use alt=""
- Forms must validate, prevent spam (honeypot), and show clear success/failure states

### Performance
- Avoid heavy libraries
- Minimize client components (use Server Components by default)
- Optimize images and assets

### Content
- Professional, family-friendly, museum-appropriate copy
- Separate nonprofit content from any film/commercial promotions
- Keep copy clear and educational

### Component Structure
- Layout components: `components/layout/`
- Section components: `components/sections/`
- Form components: `components/forms/`
- UI components: `components/ui/`

### Forms
- Use validators from `lib/validators.ts`
- Include honeypot spam protection
- Show clear success/failure states
- Validate on both client and server

### SEO
- Use `generateSEO()` from `lib/seo.ts` for metadata
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Semantic HTML

## File Organization
- Pages: `app/(site)/`
- API routes: `app/api/`
- Components: `components/`
- Utilities: `lib/`
- Styles: `app/globals.css`
- Public assets: `public/`
